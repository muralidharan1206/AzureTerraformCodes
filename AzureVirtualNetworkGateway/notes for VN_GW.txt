Virtual Network Gateway:
------------------------
configuration of VNET-VNET.
---------------------------
1. Create Resource group 
2. Create 2 virtual networks 
3. Create 2 subnets for virtual machines
4. Create 2 subnets for virtual machine gateway
5. Create 2 Virtual machine on the 2 subnets.
6. Create 2 NI for the VM's 
7. Attach 2 public IP in the 2 NI.
8. Create 2 Virtual Network Gateway
9. Create 2 public IP for Virtual Network Gateway
10. configure the 2 gateways to communicate to each other, with the help of "connection"


Notes:

Virtual network gateway is used to connect two different networks.
three types of connection is available
1. VNET to VNET --> Connection in between the Vnet's which are all in different regions. 
2. site to site --> Connection between the on-premise and cloud
3. point to site --> connection between on-premise and service provider.

We can configure any of these to route the traffic.

The same action is done via "Peering", which is not a encrypted one. whereas this "virtual network gateway"  is encrypted one. 

(Im not sure about these three, refer google)
